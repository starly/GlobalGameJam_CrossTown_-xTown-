# X-Town
A board game to race across NYC and return your landmark home.

This game is still under development. Please experiment with the rules.

## Rules
### Background
You are a New York City landmark that wakes up in the wrong part of town. It seems the universe has been jumbled up last night. To let your friends know you’r’e okay, you’re going to check in with your other landmark friend throughout the city before making your way home. At the same time, other players will be doing the same. This is a turn-based race to visit friends and find your way home via the NYC subway system. 

### Game Objective
Each player assumes the role of a landmark. As a lost landmark, you must visit 6 other landmarks by stopping at the subway station closest to the visited landmark’s home OR visit all 5 boroughs before returning to the home stop of your landmark. Other landmarks can only be visited twice in a game, unless the landmark is currently in play. In which case, their home can only be visited once by any player. After that the initial visits, subsequent visits from other players do not count.

### Game Setup
Every player rolls a die. The highest roller gets to pick the landmark, they want to be and wherever they want to go on the board. Proceeding clockwise, all subsequent players must pick a landmark and draw a random borough from the borough deck. The player must start anywhere in the borough they have drawn. Players are not allowed to start directly on another landmark’s home.

### Turns
When the turn begins, players must roll the die and draw an event card. The number you roll is the maximum number of stops (local or express) that you may travel. Players may only travel on one subway line per turn. When transferring lines you must end your turn at the transfer station and wait for the next train. All effects of the drawn event card applies immediately.

The first player to visit a landmark will claim the token and the second player to visit a landmark will claim the card. Additionally, if you enter a new borough, you must draw a borough card to signify you have visited said borough. 6 landmarks tokens/cards or 5 borough cards are required in order for you to win the game when you return home.

## Materials
To build the board game, you will need the following materials:
* An MTA Subway Map
* A 6-sided die
* Printed event cards (refer to uploaded event card deck)
* Printed images of landmarks (refer to the landmark list below)
* 3d printed landmarks (refer to table below)

Here's a list of the 3d models we've used. Feel free to substitute in your own.
There were several landmarks that were not printer friendly when scaled down to board game tokens size and have thus been omitted. To reproduce our token size, we have document scaling in the X, Y, and Z axes in the table below.
